		    	</b><br><br>
		    	<p>
		    		The school is dedicated to creating and maintaining a positive learning environment for all students. The school community (students,staff,parents,school management and community members) must assume a responsible role for promoting behavior that enhances academic and social successs. Respectful ane responsible behavior fosters a positive climate for the learning community.<br><br>

                    Our school must be free of disruptions that interfere with teaching and learning  at school and during School-related activitues and events. Therefore, school officials have the authority to regulate student conduct at school-related activities, and where the conduct creates a substaintial risk of disruption to the educational process or to an orderly school environment.<br><br>

                    Discipline procedures and necessary in order to protect the rights of each member of the school community. Therefore, effective student discipline can only be achieved through co operation and a shared commitment among the School community. The student Code of Conduct has been designed to establish student responsibilities and expectations.<br>
